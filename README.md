### Self Learning Model Using Random Forest

**Objective:** A US based dealership (ADESA) which buys used cars and then resells them for a profit. The objective of this exercise is to identify if it is worth buying a car or not. A bad buy leads to large costs and huge losses for the company. 

**Self-learning model:** A self-learning AI model refers to an artificial intelligence system that has the ability to learn and improve from data without explicit human intervention or supervision. These models typically improve over time as they are exposed to more data and feedback, enabling them to adapt and make more accurate predictions, decisions, or perform tasks more efficiently.
